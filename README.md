## Features

* Syntax highlighting for Bitsy game data files
* Some invalid syntax is highlighted as invalid

## Known Issues

* Dialogs are rendered as block text; there is no highlighting of the structure within a dialog.
* Hack-specific syntax is not handled
* `VAR` values not highlighted as constants/strings
* Sections are delimited by empty lines, which doesn't work with the simple folding/unfolding mechanism for Visual Studio Code extensions
